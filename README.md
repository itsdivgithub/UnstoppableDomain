### UNSTOPPABLE DOMAIN Integration ###


- A Lottery Game to keep our supporters engaged to keep recycling waste items and by making best out of it get an equal chance of winning every day.

- **Use of Chainlink -**
- Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) - [https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/backend/contracts/Raffle.sol](https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/backend/contracts/Raffle.sol)
- This is used to generate a random winner from the list of people who have recycled and build something best out of it on a particular day and have minted their NFTs.
- Chainlink Keepers Functions - [https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/backend/contracts/Raffle.sol](https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/backend/contracts/Raffle.sol)
- This is used to automate the smart contracts by running the Verifiable Random Function to help in selecting the winner every day.
- The checkUpkeep function will check if the lottery has ended or not.
- the performUpkeep function will automatically execute the functions in a set time period when the day has ended. This function also automatically sends the amount to the winner of that day.

- **Use of IPFS -**
- I have used NFT Port to mint the images clicked by the users as NFTs.
- The images get minted as an NFT and get stored on the IPFS.
- Implementation of NFTPORT - [https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/components/MintNFT.js](https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade/blob/master/components/MintNFT.js)


### TESTING GUIDE - 



1. Run the backend code to get your smart contract deployed on rinkeby network 


```
git clone https://github.com/itsdivgithub/RecycloMade
cd backend
yarn install
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```
- Make .env file - 
```
RINKEBY_RPC_URL='https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/<YourApiKey>'
 PRIVATE_KEY='df2d4d383b4fe08c657cc1a178khg088d3fcc5f1c49fde53678oiue31cd444c8' // Private Key of Test Metamask Wallet
REPORT_GAS=true
AUTO_FUND=true
VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=5466  // Get your VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID from here - https://vrf.chain.link/
```
- Use the Contract Address that you got to Register for new Upkeep - https://keepers.chain.link/rinkeby/new

2. Now run the frontend
```
cd ../
yarn install
yarn dev
```

3. Go to UI and have fun!

Head over to your [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and play with the lottery!

# Deploying to IPFS

1. Build your static code.

```
yarn build
```

2. Export your site

```
yarn next export
```

> Note: Some features of NextJS & Moralis are not static, if you're deviating from this repo, you might run into errors. 

3. Deploy to IPFS

- [Download IPFS desktop](https://ipfs.io/#install)
- Open your [IPFS desktop app](https://ipfs.io/)
- Select `import` and choose the folder the above step just created (should be `out`)

4. Copy the CID of the folder you pinned

![IPFS](./img/readme-ipfs.png)

5. Get [IPFS companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch?hl=en) for your browser (or use [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/))

5. Go to `ipfs://YOUR_CID_HERE` and see your ipfs deployed site!
